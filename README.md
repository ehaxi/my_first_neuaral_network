# A neural network that determines a digit from an image
A neural network designed to identify a digit based on its image. This network uses the Backpropagation and Gradient descent algorithms for training. Such a neural network can be used for recognizing handwritten digits in images, for example, in text recognition tasks or image processing systems.
